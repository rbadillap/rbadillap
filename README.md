# Modern Personal Website for Entrepreneurs

## Vision

A reimagined personal website that breaks away from traditional portfolio concepts, drawing inspiration from modern software interfaces like Raycast and Linear. This website aims to be both a showcase of professional capabilities and a demonstration of technical expertise through its design and functionality.

## Core Philosophy

- **Command-First Navigation**: Embracing keyboard-driven interfaces with a central command bar that serves as the primary navigation method
- **Interoperability as Design Principle**: Building systems that communicate and integrate with other tools and platforms
- **Minimal Yet Powerful Design**: Adopting a clean, focused aesthetic that eliminates distractions and emphasizes what matters
- **Technical Excellence as Content**: Demonstrating expertise through the implementation itself

## Key Features

### Command Bar Interface

The command bar serves as the heart of the entire experience:

- Global keyboard shortcut (⌘K) to access from anywhere
- Smart search with keywords and context-awareness
- Direct actions for efficient navigation
- Comprehensive command palette covering all site functionality

### True Interoperability

Beyond just exposing data, the site offers deep integration capabilities:

- **Webhooks**: Subscribe to events for real-time updates
- **Multiple Data Formats**: Export information in various formats (JSON, XML, vCard, PDF)
- **SDKs & Client Libraries**: Easily integrate with the platform
- **Embeddable Widgets**: Include profile info and projects on other sites

### Professional Expertise Showcase

Rather than overwhelming with content, the site quietly demonstrates expertise through:

- **Clean, Minimal Design**: Shows design sensibility and focus
- **Technical Implementation**: Reveals development skill through the experience
- **API-First Approach**: Demonstrates understanding of modern architecture

### User Experience Focus

- Dramatic, focused homepage that guides to command-driven interaction
- Thoughtful animations and micro-interactions
- Typography-first design with careful attention to readability
- Dark/light mode with seamless transitions

## Technical Implementation

- **Next.js 15 with App Router**: For modern React server components
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui**: For high-quality, accessible UI components
- **Modern API Design**: RESTful endpoints with multiple response formats

## Project Structure

```

  api/                # Comprehensive API with true interoperability
    webhooks/         # Webhook subscription management

  command-bar/        # Command-driven navigation system
  layout/             # Layout components with minimal design
  ui/                 # shadcn UI components
lib/                  # Utility functions and shared code
```

## Why This Approach Matters

Traditional personal websites often fail to stand out or demonstrate the full capabilities of modern entrepreneurs. This command-driven, interoperable approach offers several advantages:

1. **Demonstrates Technical Knowledge**: Shows rather than tells about technical expertise
2. **Creates a Memorable Experience**: Visitors remember the unique interaction model
3. **Showcases Product Thinking**: Reveals how you approach user experience and design
4. **Illustrates Integration-First Mindset**: Proves understanding of modern ecosystem thinking

The site becomes more than a portfolio—it's a functional product that represents your capabilities.
