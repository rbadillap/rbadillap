Ever since I can remember, I dreamed of building something unique inside a computer. At 11 - when everything started - I fell in love with that first computer my father brought to home: it was magical, infinite, and taught me something new every day. Since then, learning to me is my spirit, it's a job, a way of life.

## AI

When AI started to take off, something lit up inside me again. That curiousity to learn, to put into practice, to improve everyday, I’ve always been saw a chance to do something big. I love seeing people realizing how AI is starting to transform their lives. People using AI chatbots, and waiting for a response that might change everything. But AI chatbots are weird don't you think?, it's like using AI with 5% of battery, soon you'll have to restart the conversation. 

## It's just different way...

AI chatbots remind me these old ages when we used to chat on a general room, it was chaotic, a bunch of useless information but it's still there because there are no other ways to chat, and we’re still dragging that idea along. 

I don’t want generic chats or bots that guess who I am. I want an AI that understands me, organizes me, and is a real assistant.

## Syner is Synergy

Syner is my bet on breaking the mold: leaving behind endless chats and building the next interface. I imagine a modern WebOS, not with ordinary apps, but with AI that works for you—a translator on the fly, a calendar that thinks, a buddy to bounce ideas off. The sky’s the limit. I’m not saying it’s the only way or the absolute truth; I’m saying it’s the next step, and **Syner** is opening it up.

## Syner must give real value

My commitment is simple: when I look at Syner, I want to feel it’s the best thing I’ve done in my life. And I’ll only measure it by one thing: how much value it adds to the people who use it. That’s the real power I’m after. This isn’t about technology for technology’s sake; it’s about us, about giving AI a purpose that serves us. That’s why Syner isn’t just another assistant: it’s one that takes control for you with a single chat. No more jumping between conversations or repeating yourself so it “remembers.” You ask for something—organize your schedule, create a dashboard, do some research—and it happens, just like in real life. I don’t care if it needs a second to check or adjust dynamic contexts; let the AI handle it, not you. 

> Syner is my way of working with AI from now on, the way it always should have been.
